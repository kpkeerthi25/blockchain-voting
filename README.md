# blockchain-voting
My idea is that any indian citizen can cast their vote in dedicated voting booth anywhere. Thus they need not come to thier native for this purpose.
A distributed ledger does this purpose.when a voter cast his vote in any voting booth, all the ledgers get updated. It also validates his identity and restricts multiple casting using smart contracts.
A user voting  app could be created like casting thier votes in thier phone and the results could be live but it is not feasible since it could lead to some discrepancies as the voters could be forced to vote to a certain person and if the results are live the mentality  of the individual  will always drive them to vote to the winning party.
Hyperledger fabric can be used. If a person casts his vote, All the distributed ledgers given to the election officers in every booths gets updated that the user have casted his vote. Thus making the public to vote with convenience and this could also increase the poll percentage.
